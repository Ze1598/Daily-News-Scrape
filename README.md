# Daily-News-Scrape

A simple project that uses a Python script to scrape news titles and their URLs from various websites, then writes the information to a .txt and an .html file.

Future Updates:
-I expect to keep updating this repo over time, as I make changes to the page's style and add/update the news sources.

Update log:

-(may 27th 2018) Updated the script to scrape news from more sources. I've also commented out the option to write the news to a .txt file, so now running the script only outputs the .html file (hence the difference in dates in the 2 example files uploaded to ther repo).

-(nov 20th 2018) Updated the script code's to be cleaner and more streamlined. I also updated the page's style and a added a couple of new news sources. Along with these changes I uploaded an example file to showcase what type of file the Python scripts creates now.
