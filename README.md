# Daily-News-Scrape

A simple project that uses a Python script to scrape news titles and their URLs from various websites, then writes the information to a .txt and an .html file.

Future Updates:
-I expect to keep updating this project in the next few days since I want to scrape news from more websites, and maybe even change the HTML structure or just the CSS.
